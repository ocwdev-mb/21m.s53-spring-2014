## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21M.S53 Chinese Popular Musics in Dialogue_ as it was taught by Dr. Meredith Schweig in Spring 2014.

This course introduced students to the major popular music cultures of the Chinese-speaking world. Emphasis was placed on listening beyond the notion of a monolithic “Chinese popular music” to something more dynamic, multivocal, and translocal. Interactive experiences, including contributing to a class blog, creating multimedia compositions through the use of [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/), and conducting participant observation at a concert, were at the core of this course.
